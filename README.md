# MMS: Memory Management System (Java Simulation)

This project simulates a simple Memory Management System (MMS) using linked lists in Java. It was created as part of an academic assignment at York University for the course ITEC 2620 (Summer 2025).

---

## üìå Overview

The MMS manages memory allocation and deallocation requests from processes using two linked lists:
- `allocList`: stores memory blocks allocated to processes
- `freeList`: tracks free/available memory blocks

---

## üîß Features

- **Smallest Fit Allocation Strategy**: Allocates memory using the smallest available block that fits the request.
- **Dynamic Freeing**: Frees all memory blocks associated with a process name.
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatically compacts memory when no block is large enough due to fragmentation.
- **Sorted Allocation List**: Maintains `allocList` in increasing order of address for simpler garbage collection.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Compile
```bash
javac MMS.java
```

### Run
```bash
java MMS
```

### Commands
```text
alloc <name> <size>
free <name>
printalloc
printfree
exit
```
